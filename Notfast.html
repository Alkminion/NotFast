      <h2> Shaun Howell's 1994 For Probe GT </h2>
        <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56cf9f524d088e8ab0507f2f/t/573e91e922482e41b0442b49/1463719862023/?format=1500w">
          <h3> "Who builds a probe...?" </h3>
            <div id='firstparagraph'>   
              <p><b>Shaun Howell did.</b> And he did a damn good job. If you have ever seen a stock Ford Probe, and you're anything like me, you'd struggle to find anything really impressive about them. Granted, the pop-up lights definitely add to the "cool factor" but, in all honesty, that's about the only "cool factor" they have. But, these are factory Probes we're talking about. Shaun's Probe is a different story.</p>
            </div>

            <div id='secondparagraph'>
              <p>Shaun saw much more when he looked at a Probe. He saw, in his words, "the pop-up lights and cool body lines adding up to something clean." So off he went, he began modifying a red 2.0L Probe SE. It wasn't easy, when I asked him about the Probe aftermarket, he didn't even look up-- "there isn't one (laughs)". He originally put it on a set of SVT Cobra 5-spoke wheels, installed coilovers, and just tried to clean the car up. The simple beginnings were nothing too special, and he says that, inevitably, he began to get "why the hell are you building a Probe...?" and other 'words of encouragement' from every direction. He just kept right along building his Probe though, because he liked it-- and it was HIS car to build.</p>

              <p><b>Then came the setback;</b> in the form of an accident that totaled the red Probe. But that setback became a turning point. Shaun decided to show everyone just how clean a Ford Probe could be. He found a black Probe GT 5MT and got right down to work. Initially, he moved all of the intact aftermarket parts over from the old Probe to the new Probe GT. He improved the interior with Bride VIOS 3 seats and Takata harnesses. The Nardi wheel and NRG quick-release hub were also a nice touch. But the real beauty of this build is the paint. A full repaint is always nice, but he added a red pearl on top of the black basecoat to create a paint job that truly deserves to be seen in person. He was also able to reimagine and adjust his fitment to be more aggressive, using new wheels with better offsets. But that wasn't enough-- he wanted to go lower.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="fourthparagraph">
              <p>   <b>There was only one option.</b> Shaun and his father worked together using Airlift's "Builder's Kit" to completely custom build the airbag suspension for the Probe, because unsurprisingly, there was not a prebuilt kit. To create the impressive fitment that it sits on he uses the Autopilot V2 management system. And with bags, came the necessity to have some seriously aggressive wheels, and we like the choice that he made-- staggered 18x9(&9.5) Work VSKFs with a flaked gloss white face. </p>

              <p><b>It may be a Ford, but make no mistake, this is a Japanese car.</b> It's okay, I didn't know either. The Ford Probe is built on a Mazda GE chassis, the same chassis as the '94 Mazda 626 and the '94 Mazda MX-6. The pop-up headlight mechanisms also come from a Mazda RX-7 FC. The Probe GT's 2.5L V6 engine is in fact, a Mazda KL-DE DOHC engine. Full bolt-ons to a straight pipe create a nice, solid sound from the 165 hp V6. A lightweight flywheel, gutted KL-G4 intake manifold, and square-ported heads are a couple more of the labors of love Shaun put into the engine.</p>

              <p><b>Driven by doubt, Shaun built an amazingly clean Ford Probe.</b> The first thing I thought when I saw this car for the first time at SoWo <b>(RIP)</b> last year was, "who did this?!" I couldn't believe that someone built a Ford Probe! But my reaction had a more positive spin than what Shaun says he was used to. "I kind of built it out of spite (laughs). All these people would tell me that you can't make a Probe clean or cool or whatever, and I was going to prove them wrong. I knew it could be a clean car, so I built it to where I wanted it. Now, I get alot more positive feedback, I'm just kinda thinking 'I told you' (laughs)." Shaun did what alot of people won't do these days; he went against the grain and built EXACTLY what he wanted; because that's what he wanted to build-- regardless of other people's opinions. And as far as I'm concerned, it paid off in a BIG way. He is a part of rare breed that we at notfast. hope to bring into the spotlight; those who build a car out of passion, creativity, and originality (not to mention, effort). Not because everyone else would think it's cool, but because it's what you like, and what you enjoy. Because if Shaun never built his car, you still wouldn't know how amazing a Ford Probe can look.</p>
